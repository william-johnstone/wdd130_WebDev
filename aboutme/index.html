        <h2>William Johnstone</h2>
        <p>
            My name is William Johnstone.  I was born in California and stayed their until I went to college in Utah.  I've had Type I Diabetes for over 40 years.
            I served a mission to Spokane, Washington.  After my mission, i came back to Utah and started working and preparing to go back to school.  I met my 
            beautiful wife not too long after coming home and we have been married for almost a quarter of a century.  We have three wonderful boys.  Our oldest has 
            graduated High School and is working part time and figuring out his next steps.  Our middle son is in Choir and just got back from a trip to New York 
            where he was able to see Hamilton on Broadway.  He also will be singing the National Anthem at a major league baseball game in a couple of weeks.  We're 
            very excited for him!  My youngest son just started High School and he is really branching out in his interests.  He loves Youtube and video games, but 
            he also loves taking care of our pet cat!

            I've been working with the same company for over 20 years.  I started with the company answering technical questions and have worked my way up to be a
            manager over an engineering team.  We use a wide variety of tools to do ETL work.  I'm excited to be back in school and learning new things.  My original
            degree was in English Literature so my career and my new degree went in quite a different direction.
