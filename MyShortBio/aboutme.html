            <p>
                My passion is computers and technology; however, I have a love for many forms of art and media.  I love playing games, both board and video.  I love watching movies with my family.  I love listening to music and have attended concerts for country singers, rock bands, electronic, and classical symphonies. My wife and i really enjoy watching shows together, going on walks, and spending time together going to concerts, movies, and other fun activites.  We also love to attend church together and participate in spiritually uplifting activites.  I have a passion for being a moral and ethical person.  I want to make sure i am doing right and doing good.

                Working remotely has changed my life in many ways.  In the year 2023 I decided that I wanted to be prepared in case I need to change careers or positions so I have started up going to school to get my bachelors degree in software development.
