I would like to create a Portfolio Website as my project proposal.  I want to have the website be a visual representation of what a resume might look like.  I would use this as a potential link on a resume or cover letter for job applications.
Proposal: Portfolio Website
Home Page - Critical Info about me
Skills Page - job related skills Page
Hobbies Page - page showing interests/hobbies/family

Needs:
1. Text on each page
2. At least one image related to content/text
3. links between pages
4. laid out according to wireframe
5. visually appealing and readable
